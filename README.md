# Schaukasten

This project is a helper that reads a calendar that is maintained in a format similar to the calendar of the `Queerreferat Aachen` and parses it into a pdf summary. Other output formats might follow.

## Install

As for now, since this project is still in development, you can install and use this tool using the build and dependency management tool [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). If you fulfill the version requirements (3.12) poetry should automatically create a new virtualenv for you. Look in the Poetry doc for alternative ways to define the env if you dont want that.

You install all dependecies with

```bash
poetry install
```

We recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) as a python version manager if you still need the correct python version, i.e. when poetry complains you would not have a compatible python version.
